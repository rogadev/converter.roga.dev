# Product Overview

Converter is an in-browser file conversion tool that focuses on:

- **Image re-encoding**: PNG, JPEG, WEBP, AVIF format conversions
- **Video to GIF conversion**: MP4 → GIF using FFmpeg WASM
- **Privacy-first approach**: No uploads required - everything runs locally in the browser
- **Client-side processing**: Uses Canvas API for images and FFmpeg WASM for video processing

The application prioritizes user privacy by ensuring all file processing happens locally without sending data to external servers.
